**Week 1**<br>
The learning goals for this week can be split into two parts. One is how to keep good version control of codes by setting up Git with a clear structure and another being MCU and FPGA board assembly and tests. By the end of this week's lab, I hope I can learn how to write Verilog code to test out the hardware on board, perform logic simulations in Radiant, and deepen my understanding of circuit debugging.  <br>

Here are the learning objective from the course website for Lab 1:<br>
*- Assembled your development board for the class and tested out your MCU and FPGA boards.*<br>
*- Written a Verilog module to control LEDs and a 7-segment display.*<br>
*- Programmed the FPGA with Verilog code.* <br>
*- Gained confidence in building, assembling, testing, and debugging circuits.* <br>
*- Interfaced a 7-segment display to the board.* <br>
